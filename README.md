# Machine Learning Project - 3rd Semester UnderGrad

## Second Hand Car Price Prediction

Faculty incharge - Dr. Sanatan Sukhija

**_Project Abstract : -_** <br/>
While buying a used-car/ second-hand car, it is difficult to know whether the price posted in the ad is worth the actual price or not. Moreover, there are many factors that determine the worth of a car. Our project is to make a prediction model to determine the price of used cars. We will also be predicting the price of the car based on its location.

1.  To run the project, first clone the repo. Then run data_preprocessing.ipynb in google colab. In order to run it locally, preprocessed dataset must be downloaded (FinalVehiclesData.csv).

2.  Run model_training.ipynb

3.  In case you are running it in google colab entirely, just running model_training.ipynb should be enough!
